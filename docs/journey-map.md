## Cindy's journey
Referencing our target persona (Cindy) and research interviews, our team produced a journey map of key stages in Cindy’s interaction with Lightspeed’s brand and content. In doing so, we charted four key stages in Cindy’s journey: awareness, research, recommend, and engagement. Keeping in mind our core strategy, we identified touchpoints at which Lightspeed’s content can support Cindy’s goals and address her frustrations. We’ve also identified further opportunities and proposed internal ownership for specific phases of interaction with Lightspeed’s brand.
