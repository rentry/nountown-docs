**Team lead:** Ryan Johnson

## Methodology
Referencing our target persona (Cindy) and research interviews, our team produced a journey map of key stages in Cindy’s interaction with Lightspeed’s brand and content. In doing so, we charted four key stages in Cindy’s journey: awareness, research, recommend, and engagement. Keeping in mind our core strategy, we identified touchpoints at which Lightspeed’s content can support Cindy’s goals and address her frustrations. We’ve also identified further opportunities and proposed internal ownership for specific phases of interaction with Lightspeed’s brand.

Cindy teaches first grade at a public school in Corvallis, Oregon. With a decade of experience in the classroom, she’s considered passionate, proactive and engaged by her peers. Cindy is willing to go above and beyond to ensure her students’ success, even when it means she’ll need to take on extra work.

### Scenario 
Class sizes are getting bigger each academic year at Cindy’s school. As her class roster grows, she is finding it difficult to keep her students’ attention and connect with each pupil. Inclined to embrace new technologies, Cindy hopes to identify new in-class audio solutions to address these barriers, as well as equip herself for future shifts in classroom formats (e.g., distance and hybrid).

### Expectations
- An easy-to-navigate online experience that clearly outlines the value of Lightspeed
- A variety of up-to-date educational resources covering the company’s solutions
- Convincing downloadable and shareable online materials that she can leverage while pitching Lightspeed to her school administrators
- Evidence of a strong customer support team

### Key stages

- Detects a correlation between students’ ability to focus and their proximity to her
- Believes that some of her students are having issues seeing and hearing her
- Asks herself if there’s anything she can do to help her students who are struggling
- Confirms other teachers are experiencing similar issues

> “I love my kids, but I feel like I’m losing them.”

> “Without additional support, I can’t do my job effectively as class sizes continue to grow.”

#### Research
- Searches the web to identify potential classroom audio technology solutions
- Finds the Lightspeed website and digs deeper into the company’s product offerings
- Watches videos of previous Lightspeed webinars and registers for an upcoming session
- Reads a case study and downloads the document to share with her team

> “I need to build a strong case for Lightspeed to convince administrators of its value.”

#### Recommend
- Leverages buyer’s kit templates to build a strong business case for Lightspeed’s technologies
- Outlines key benefits of Lightspeed in an email to the school administrator and technology director; requests in-person follow-up meeting
- Presents her recommendation via an in-person pitch meeting, highlighting all of her takeaways—opportunities, questions and concerns

> “I believe the value of this technology is worth the cost. We can’t afford to let our students down.”

> “Yes! The school purchased the system.”
