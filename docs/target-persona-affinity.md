## Methodology

NounTown conducted six phone interviews with teachers from around the world, including the US West Coast, Texas and Russia. A few notes about the team’s interviewees:

- They work primarily in public elementary schools, including one special-ed teacher
- Each has a combination of experiences with in person, distance and hybrid teaching formats
- Their comfort with adopting, learning, and implementing new tech in their classrooms spanned a wide range

NounTown brainstormed potential interview questions as a team, then worked to pare ~30 questions down to eight. After conducting interviews, final transcripts were shared across the team. As individuals, we pulled out the top insights from our conversations and added them in our bank of sticky notes in [Miro](https://miro.com/). 

From there, we looked for commonality across the team’s top interview insights. With sticky notes bunched into natural-feeling groups, we created fitting titles for our overarching theme buckets.

## Interview questions

- In the past year, have you taught primarily in person, in a virtual classroom or a hybrid model?
- What are a few of your biggest challenges teaching right now?
- How would you describe the effectiveness of your current classroom setup? What could be improved?
- Do you feel like all students in your classroom, regardless of instructional format, have equal ability to see and hear you and each other? If not, please explain.
- When you think about the ideal classroom for effective learning, what does it look and sound like?
- What is the process by which you identify and request solutions to educational barriers?
- What are your thoughts about adding new technology to your classroom?
- How would you describe your school administration’s appetite for pursuing new classroom technologies?
